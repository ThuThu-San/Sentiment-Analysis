2020,BBC,rEAA5twFhyM,UK Chancellor warns of “economic emergency” with worst downturn for 300 years - BBC News,"The extent of the economic and financial crisis facing the UK has been spelled out by the chancellor Rishi Sunak.

He told MPs that the cost of fighting the pandemic has led to record government borrowing and the steepest economic decline in more than three centuries.

Next year more than 2.5m people could be out of work in the UK.  This year the government will be borrowing nearly £400 billion, the highest ever in peacetime.

Most public sector workers will get a pay freeze — other than NHS staff and those earning less than £24,000 a year. 

The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated that the UK economy will shrink by more than 11% this year alone.

The prime minister, in an unexpected statement in parliament, announced spending would be increased to 2.5% of the UK's GDP by 2027 from the current 2.3%.

That will mean £13.4 billion more for defence each year after 2027, he said.

Sir Keir said he wants defence spending to increase to 3% of GDP in the next parliament, but that would rely on Labour winning the next election, set for 2029.

It comes just weeks after the Trump administration made major cuts to USAID, the US government's arm for humanitarian, development and security programmes around the world.

Yalda Hakim spoke to the former UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, to ask him what he makes of the prime minister's announcement and what it means for the future of aid.

2025,SKY,gstkDHKZzrc,Starmer faces first PMQs since boosting defence budget,"Sir Keir Starmer has faced Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch for the first time since announcing a boost to the defence budget. 

Badenoch pressed Starmer on what specific actions he would take to ensure Ukraine is involved in peace negotiations.

He affirmed: ""It is right Ukraine must be at the table in negotiations.""

Badenoch then reminded him of her suggestion to the prime minister over the weekend to cut the aid budget.

In response, the PM dismissed her influence, saying: ""She didn’t feature in my thinking at all"" regarding the defence spending increase. 

He added: ""I was so busy at the weekend I didn’t see her proposal,"" and quipped ""she's appointed herself the saviour of Western civilisation - it's a desperate search for relevance.""

He acknowledged the ""old-fashioned"" nature of this approach but emphasized the need for financial clarity. 

Mr Cartlidge also voiced support for Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who affirmed her party’s backing for the government if they increase defence spending.

However, he stressed that borrowing and taxes cannot be relied upon, as both are already at unsustainable levels.

The plan to shift defence spending to 3% of GDP (and a new Downing Street podium slogan) is a pivot for the PM.  
 
Sam and Anne discuss the reasons behind it - is this all about having enough to say to Donald Trump in Washington this week? Or is there a glimmer of the vision for Blue Labour Starmer showing through too? 
 
They also go over the reaction to the cuts to the international aid budget and whether the politics of that move could be easier for Labour than people might think. 
 
Elsewhere, NHS England needs a new boss – will that be the gateway for the reforms which Wes Streeting has talked about?
